# Microcontroller Unit (mcu) Build 
In this assignment you will be breadboarding a microcontroller creating an Arduino Uno-like prototyping board.

# Materials

## Breadboarding parameters
- READ the instructions
- Power circuit has to be at the end of the breadboard
- Hookup wiring has to lay flat against the breadboard (no loops)
- No exposed metal on hookup wiring
- Trim long component terminals (resistors, LEDs, caps need to lay flat against board)
- “Label” negative wiring where power is connected
- Inspection by Dr. P. - 1) Power circuit, 2) Main circuit, 3) Custom mods
